# Introduction to Carrboro composting

In 2023, the Town of Carrboro (in Orange County, NC) began awarding Green Neighborhood grants (https://townofcarrboro.org/2778/Green-Neighborhoods-Grant-Program). Fairoaks HOA Composting resulted from this grant program to help educate and to encourage community composting within their neighborhood. Using CompostNow, commercial composting services, Fairoaks was able to offer composting of items such as pizza boxes, meat, and dairy for households. 

## Why composting?

As with most things, it is complicated. One of the main reasons to compost is help divert food waste and compostables from the landfill. This is not simply for environmental reasons but there is also a monetary cost to municipalities to landfill waste. "In NC, municipal tipping fees for waste removal, or the cost to dispose of waste at a landfill, are typically calculated based on the weight of the waste, with a common rate of around $37 per ton for municipal solid waste, plus a state excise tax of $2 per ton." In otherwords, waste disposal is not free. It costs taxpayers to dispose of their waste through their municipalities.

According to a recent analysis report in 2025 regarding landfill waste for Orange County, approximately 27% of material going to the landfill for the county is food waste which could be composted.

## Our goal

To promote composting in Carrboro in an effort to reduce waste, reduce emissions, and create healthier soils.

## How we started

Fairoaks Compost was launched in September 2023 with the help of a Green Neighborhoods grant from the Town of Carrboro. Since then our pilot program has been replicated in Barred Owl Creek, the Cedars, Twin Magnolias, and Wexford.  Our goal is to help the town of Carrboro  reach its climate action goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 80% by 2030.  In addition, we’re helping Orange County on its Road to Zero Waste by 2045. 

In our first pilot year, Fairoaks diverted about 9.5 tons of food waste from the landfill, and in the process avoided the production of ~1 ton of methane (25 tons CO2e*). In the process, we’re creating better soil and a more resilient ecosystem.  You can track the progress of all of our neighborhood efforts here (link to the Track Our Progress Page).

*When food waste breaks down without the presence of oxygen (anaerobically), it process produces methane, a greenhouse gas that is more than 28 times as potent as carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere. Because many organizations will report and track CO2 emissions, it’s often useful to calculate a CO2 equivalent (CO2e) when reporting the effect of our composting efforts.
