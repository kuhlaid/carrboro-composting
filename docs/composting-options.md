# Composting options

There are many forms of composting, from backyard to commercial. Some composting can be done by worms using vermicomposting. Other materials such as meat and dairy, are usually composted commercially using 'hot composting' to help kill pathogens. As we grow this site we will seek to include additionaly resources to help you learn about composting options in your neighborhood or municipality.

Orange County, NC has a good resource at https://orangecountync.gov/1150/Compost-at-Home to help you learn more about composting.
