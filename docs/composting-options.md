# Composting options

There are many forms of composting, from backyard to commercial. Meat and dairy are usually composted commercially using 'hot composting' to help reduce pathogens. Some people compost using worms, a process known as vermicomposting. 

Orange County, NC has [resources to help you learn more about composting](https://orangecountync.gov/1150/Compost-at-Home). The county also sells [counter top and backyard composting bins](https://www.orangecountync.gov/2690/Compost-Bins-For-Sale).

## Home Composting

Composting in your backyard is one of the best ways to compost. Your food waste doesn’t travel very far before it breaks down into a beautiful soil amendment. And, you get to use it to improve the soil on your own property. It’s a win, win!

There are many ways that you can compost at home. Below are a few things you will need to get started:

- [ ] Some sort of container to collect your food scraps. Some people use a repurposed large tupperware container, others have a dedicated kitchen food scrap [compost bin like the ones sold by Orange County](https://www.orangecountync.gov/2690/Compost-Bins-For-Sale). Remember reuse is best! Perhaps you can use something you already have instead of buying something new. You can store this container of food scraps on your counter top, under your kitchen sink, in the refrigerator or in the freezer. (The colder storage options help keep fruit flies and smells to a minimum.)
- [ ] A place to put the compost in your backyard. [Orange County sells backyard compost bins here](https://www.orangecountync.gov/2690/Compost-Bins-For-Sale). You can also make a compost pile without the need for a dedicated bin. Do what will work best for you and your property.

### How to Compost:

- [ ] Start collecting your food scraps. You can put all food scraps in except for meat and dairy. See a more complete list below.
- [ ] Once your indoor bin is full (or as often as you like), dump its contents into the outdoor bin.
- [ ] It’s a good idea to cover the food scraps you just added with some leaves, grass clippings, or other ‘brown’ items from the list below. This will balance the ratio of nitrogen to carbon (greens to browns) and will help keep the pile from smelling.
- [ ] Stir the compost as often as you can. Some people will stir only once every couple of months, while others will stir more regularly. The more you stir, the more you will incorporate oxygen and the faster the contents will break down.
- [ ] Add water to keep the pile from drying out. The bacteria and other organisms that help your food waste break down need water and oxygen, so giving them what they need helps them do their job faster. The compost pile should ideally have the same moisture content as a damp, not wet, sponge.

## Commercial Composting drop-off sites

If you live in an apartment or don’t have a good place for a backyard bin, you can bring your food waste to a drop off site.  Orange County has three food waste drop off sites that accept food scraps.  This food waste goes to a commercial composting facility that can accept meat and dairy, in addition to the items that you can compost in your backyard.  Simply collect your food waste and bring it to one of the drop off sites below.
