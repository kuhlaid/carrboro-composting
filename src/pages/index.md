## About us

Fairoaks Compost was launched in September 2023 with the help of a Green Neighborhoods grant from the Town of Carrboro. Since then our pilot program has been replicated in Barred Owl Creek, the Cedars, Twin Magnolias, and Wexford.  Our goal is to help the town of Carrboro  reach its climate action goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 80% by 2030.  In addition, we’re helping Orange County on its Road to Zero Waste by 2045. 

In our first pilot year, we diverted xx lbs of food waste from the landfill, and avoided the production of xx lbs of methane (xx lbs CO2e*). In the process, we’re creating better soil and a more resilient ecosystem.  

*When food waste breaks down without the presence of oxygen (anaerobically), it process produces methane, a greenhouse gas that is more than 28 times as potent as carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere. Because many organizations will report and track CO2 emissions, it’s often useful to calculate a CO2 equivalent (CO2e) when reporting the effect of our composting efforts.
